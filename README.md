## Interesting techniques on this site

### @mixins media queries for breakpoints
- to show/hide elements for mobile/desktop

### animated hamburger menu morphing into an X
- using transform-origin and transform-rotate(45deg)

### <span> elements creating hamburger (no graphics)
- built using CSS on spans and &:not(:last-child)

### pseudo-class underlining links with gradient
- @header using pseudo-class to create lime green underline for nav links and controlling position:relative and position:absolute
- opacity used so we can animate that whereas we cannot animate background or display

## Browser Developer Tools New Tricks
- add new classes and permanently add a class to an element while testing
- ability to copy the styles created on-the-fly into the actual project
