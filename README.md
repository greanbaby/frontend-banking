## Interesting techniques on this site

### @mixins media queries for breakpoints
- to show/hide elements for mobile/desktop

### transform-rotate(45deg) morphing hamburger into an X
- using transform-origin to control exact position

### &:not(:last-child) creating hamburger (no graphics)
- SASS on spans all done in _header.scss

### a::before pseudo-class underlining links with gradient
- Create lime green underline for nav links and controlling position:relative and position:absolute
- opacity used to animate 

### @keyframes animation with visibility (rather than display)
- setting opacity to 0 AND visibility to none works with animations using keyframes whereas trying the same thing with display: none won't work

## Browser Developer Tools New Tricks
- add new classes and permanently add a class to an element while testing
- ability to copy the styles created on-the-fly into the actual project
